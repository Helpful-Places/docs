**HELPFUL PLACES INC.** (**“Helpful Places”**, **“Us”**, **“We”** or **“Our”**) is a company whose aim is to improve trust and foster meaningful dialogue between businesses, institutions and the communities they serve (**“Communities”**) by enabling transparency practices for data collected by digital technologies deployed in the built environment, and how that data is used and stored.  

**HELPFUL PLACES IS THE STEWARD** of an open-source “system-to-people” communication standard for digital technology in the built environment, known as Digital Trust for Places and Routines (**“DTPR”** or the **“DTPR Standard”**), that seeks to enable agency for people in the real world.  

**THE DTPR STANDARD** consists of a taxonomy of terms and associated icons, a design guide specifying their use as well as a digital channel prototype.  The DTPR Standard is free for anyone to use, provided they comply with the terms of the open-source licenses that govern their use. The DTPR Standard is available at https://github.com/helpful-places/dtpr.
